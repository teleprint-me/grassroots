a vanilla javascript library containing common tools for base development

## description
this library contains tools using nothing more than built-in web api's

## notes
- this is a personal project to help me study and explore javascript web api's

- this is not meant to be used for any particular, or specific, purpose

- if you're interested in a fully supported javascript library, then this library is not for you
